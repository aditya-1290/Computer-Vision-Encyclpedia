# Current Task: Complete Image Search Engine Update and Change Image Resolution

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update dragon_gan.py to generate images at 256x256 resolution (modify image_size, Generator, and Discriminator architectures)
- [x] Run dragon_gan.py to generate 400 dragon images at 256x256 resolution
- [x] Test image_search_engine.py to ensure it loads images from both '../images/' and 'dragon/' folders and performs search correctly
- [x] Update the original TODO.md to mark the image search engine tasks as completed
